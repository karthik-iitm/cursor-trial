This is a test note.


$$
\int_{0}^{1} x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

To evaluate the integral $\int_{0}^{1} x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}$, we can follow these steps:

1) First, we use the power rule of integration: $\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$ (where $C$ is the constant of integration)

2) In this case, $n = 2$, so we have:

   $$\int x^2 dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C$$

3) Now we apply the limits of integration:

   $$\left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}$$

Therefore, the evaluation confirms that:

$$\int_{0}^{1} x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}$$

This result represents the area under the curve $y = x^2$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 1$.
