        <div id="note-content"><p>This entire website was generated with the help of <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a>. I communicated with <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Sonnet-3.5</a> using the interface provided by Cursor just with the help of prompts. It required several prompts, but in the end I got the website I wanted. I didn't modify a single line of <code>html</code>, <code>css</code> or <code>js</code>. Partly because I don't know either of them in any detail, and also because I wanted to see if I could get away with just using markdown and have the website generated from that. Even the last part of the previous sentence was generated by AI. I just pressed "tab" to complete it.</p>
<p>Not just that, <a href="/notes/note-1.html">note-1</a> was generated with the help of Cursor as well. Not just the formatting but the step-by-step solution was also generated by the AI. It did the math. The image that you see in the note was also generated by AI, albeit with quite a few prompts. It did the plotting.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/note-2.html">Note-2</a> was completely generated by Cursor. I gave it a prompt and it generated the entire note. The prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coding -&gt; Prompt + coding -&gt; Prompting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this is the transition we are going to go through. We have entered the era of prompting. Prompting may not stay for long. We will soon move to a paradigm that gets us directly from prompts to products. I am quite sure that several startups in the valley are already working on it.</p></div>
