# Notes

This entire website was generated with the help of [Cursor](https://cursor.com/). I communicated with [Sonnet-3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) using the interface provided by Cursor just with the help of prompts. It required several prompts, but in the end I got the website I wanted. I didn't modify a single line of `html`, `css` or `js`. Partly because I don't know either of them in any detail, and also because I wanted to see if I could get away with just using markdown and have the website generated from that. Even the last part of the previous sentence was generated by AI. I just pressed "tab" to complete it.

Not just that, [note-1](note-1.html) was generated with the help of Cursor as well. Not just the formatting but the step-by-step solution was also generated by the AI. It did the math. The image that you see in the note was also generated by AI, albeit with quite a few prompts. It did the plotting.

[Note-2](note-2.html) was completely generated by Cursor. I gave it a prompt and it generated the entire note. The prompt was:

> Coding -> Prompt + coding -> Prompting

I believe this is the transition we are going to go through. We have entered the era of prompting. Prompting may not stay for long. We will soon move to a paradigm that gets us directly from prompts to products. I am quite sure that several startups in the valley are already working on it.
